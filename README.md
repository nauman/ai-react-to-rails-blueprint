# MVP to Rails Blueprint

A developer-first system to build MVPs using tools like [Lovable.dev](https://lovable.dev) and [V0.dev](https://v0.dev), 
while maintaining a structured Rails blueprint in parallel for clean, scalable migration to Ruby on Rails using Phlex and Hotwire.

---

## 🎯 Purpose

The goal of this repository is to bridge the gap between fast-paced React MVP development and robust Rails applications. 
While developers use tools like Lovable.dev or v0.dev to design React-based MVPs, this blueprint ensures Rails readiness from day one.
