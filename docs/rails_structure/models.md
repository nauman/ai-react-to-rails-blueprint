# Rails Models (shadow plan)

- List each domain model with attributes, types, validations, and associations.
- Note acts-as-taggable-on contexts per model (e.g., `acts_as_taggable_on :topics, :skills`).
- Include pagination defaults for listable models (Pagy page size) and any scope names used by controllers.
- Capture callbacks or background jobs that should exist later.
