# Rails Views (Phlex/RubyUI plan)

- For each page/component, specify the Phlex class name, props/locals, and key children/partials.
- List required rails_icons identifiers and RubyUI components to match the React UI.
- Note Turbo Frame/Stream usage expectations and any Stimulus controllers the view should hook into.
- Call out pagination UI (Pagy helpers) and tag filters that must be rendered.
