# Rails Controllers (shadow plan)

- Define routes/actions per feature and expected params (including pagination and tag filters).
- Note dependencies on Pagy (e.g., `pagy(scope)`), and how tags are applied to queries.
- Document strong params, authorization assumptions, and response formats (HTML, Turbo Stream, JSON as needed).
